## Welcome to utPLSQL, the unit testing framework for PL/SQL ##

utPLSQL is a Unit Testing framework for Oracle PL/SQL.  

It is not warranted to be free of bugs.  

Use it at your own risk (but, believe me, there's nothing very risky about it).

### To Install

 1. Unzip the software into the directory of your choice. It will create three sub-directories: Code, Examples and Doc.

 2. Open the Doc/index.html file and follow instructions in the Getting Started document for either installing or upgrading utPLSQL.

### To Use

Review the on-line documentation. Start with Getting Started, then check out Build Test Packages and dip into the User Guide as needed. 

Any questions? Go to the utPLSQL contributing page where you will find all the various ways to work with members of project development team. 

https://utplsql.github.io/contributing/

and let us know about it.
