----------
utPLSQL version 3 is a complete rewrite of utPLSQL v2 from scratch.
Version 2 still supports older versions of Oracle that are no longer available. 
The community that had developed on GitHub, decided that a new internal architecture was needed, from that version 3 was born.  

We welcome new developers to join our community and contribute to the utPLSQL project.

Primary features:
 - Support for all basic scalar data-types
 - Support for User Defined Object Types and Collections
 - Support for native cursors both strong and weak
 - Data-type aware testing
 - [Annotations](docs/userguide/annotations.md) based test definitions 
 - Extensible [matchers](docs/userguide/expectations.md)
 - Extensible reporting formats
 - Extensible output providers
 - Support for multi-reporting
 - Code coverage reporting (with different formats)
 - Runtime reporting of test execution progress
 - Well-defined API
 - Easy to call from current PL/SQL development tools
 - More permissive License to allow vendors to integrate utPLSQL without violation of license 
 - Published upgrade/conversion path from version 2 ( TODO )

Requirements:
 - Version of Oracle under [Extend Support](http://www.oracle.com/us/support/library/lifetime-support-technology-069183.pdf)  (Currently 11.2 and above)

__Download__

Published releases are available for download on the [utPLSQL GitHub Releases Page.](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/releases)


__Version 2 to Version 3 Comparison__

<sup>1</sup> Annotations are specially formatted comments in your package specification.  This enables *declarative* test configuration that is coupled with the source code.   See Documentation for more details. 

<sup>2</sup> **utAssert2** package - Contains 59 Assertions - 2 Not implemented = 57, 28 are duplicated only change on outcome_in parameter 57-28 = 29, **utPipe** package - Contains 1 Assertion 29 + 1 = 30

<sup>3</sup> Test execution comparison is in a single call so the results are combined.   We know it was always possible group in any way with multiple calls.  But that may not be desired under CI system where you want a single JUnit XML Output.

# Installation

To simply install the utPLSQL into a new database schema and grant it to public, execute the script `install_headless.sql`.

This will create a new user `UT3` with password `UT3`, grant all needed privileges to that user and create PUBLIC synonyms needed tu sue the utPLSQL framework.

Example invocation of the script from command line:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus admin/admins_password@xe @@install_headless.sql  
```

For detailed instructions on other install options see the [Install Guide](docs/userguide/install.md)

# Example test package

The below test package is a fully-functional Unit Test package for testing a function `betwnstr`.
Package specification is annotated with special comments ([annotations](docs/userguide/annotations.md)).
Annotations define that a package is a unit test suite, they also allow defining a description for the suite as well as the test itself.
Package body consists of procedures containing unit test code. To validate [an expectation](docs/userguide/expectations.md) in test, use `ut.expect( actual_data ).to_( ... )` syntax.


```sql
create or replace package test_between_string as

  -- %suite(Between string function)

  -- %test(Returns substring from start position to end position)
  procedure normal_case;

  -- %test(Returns substring when start position is zero)
  procedure zero_start_position;

  -- %test(Returns string until end if end position is greater than string length)
  procedure big_end_position;

  -- %test(Returns null for null input string value)
  procedure null_string;
end;
/

create or replace package body test_between_string as

  procedure normal_case is
  begin
    ut.expect( betwnstr( '1234567', 2, 5 ) ).to_equal('2345') );
  end;

  procedure zero_start_position is
  begin
    ut.expect( betwnstr( '1234567', 0, 5 ) ).to_( equal('12345') );
  end;

  procedure big_end_position is
  begin
    ut.expect( betwnstr( '1234567', 0, 500 ) ).to_( equal('1234567') );
  end;

  procedure null_string is
  begin
    ut.expect( betwnstr( null, 2, 5 ) ).to_( be_null );
  end;

end;
/
```


# Running tests

To execute using IDE ()TOAD/SQLDeveloper/PLSQLDeveloper/other) just run the following.
```sql
begin
  ut_runner.run();
end;
/
```
Will run all the suites in the current schema and provide documentation report using dbms_output

```
Between string function
  Returns substring from start position to end position
  Returns substring when start position is zero
  Returns string until end if end position is greater than string length
  Returns null for null input string value

Finished in .036027 seconds
4 tests, 0 failures
```

To execute your tests from command line, you will need a oracle sql client like SQLPlus or [SQLcl](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview/index.html)
You may benefit from using the [ut_run.sql](client_source/sqlplus/ut_run.sql) to execute your tests if you want to achieve one of the following:
* see the progress of test execution for long-running tests
* have output to screen with one output format (text) and at the same time have output to file in other format (xunit)

Example:
```
c:\my_work\>sqlplus /nolog @ut_run hr/hr@xe 
```
Will run all the suites in the current schema (hr) and provide documentation report into screen.
Invoking this script will show the progress after each test.
