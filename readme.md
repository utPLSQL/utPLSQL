----------
Version 3 is a complete rewrite of utPLSQL from scratch.  [Version 2](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/tree/version2) still supports older versions of Oracle that are no longer available.   This has lead to difficult to maintain code.  Yet many developers wanted to take it to the next level.  The community that had developed on GitHub, decided that a new internal architecture was needed, from that version 3 was born.  Currently version 3 is not complete and is not ready for a production environment as the API is not stable and changing.   However it is quickly taking shape.  We welcome new developers to join our community and help utPLSQL grow.

Primary Goals:
 - Easier to maintain 
  - Only supports versions of Oracle under [Extend Support](http://www.oracle.com/us/support/library/lifetime-support-technology-069183.pdf)  (Currently 11.2, and 12.1)
  - API is documented in the code where possible.
 - Robust and vibrant assertion library.
 - Support for Code Coverage
 - Extensible API
 - Published upgrade/conversion path from version 2.
 - Easily called from current PL/SQL development tools
 - More permissive License to allow vendors easier ability to integrate utPLSQL. 

__Download__

Published releases are available for download on the [utPLSQL GitHub Releases Page.](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/releases)

<sup>1</sup> Annotations are specially formatted comments in your package specification.  This enables *declarative* test configuration that is coupled with the source code.   See Documentation for more details. 

<sup>2</sup> **utAssert2** package - Contains 59 Assertions - 2 Not implemented = 57, 28 are duplicated only change on outcome_in parameter 57-28 = 29, **utPipe** package - Contains 1 Assertion 29 + 1 = 30

<sup>3</sup> Test execution comparison is in a single call so the results are combined.   We know it was always possible group in any way with multiple calls.  But that may not be desired under CI system where you want a single JUnit XML Output.

# Installation

To simply install the utPLSQL into a new database schema and grant it to public, execute the script `install_headless.sql`.

This will create a new user `UT3` with password `UT3`, grant all needed privileges to that user and create PUBLIC synonyms needed tu sue the utPLSQL framework.

Example invocation of the script from command line:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus admin/admins_password@xe @@install_headless.sql  
```

For detailed instructions on other install options see the [Install Guide](docs/userguide/install.md)

# Annotations

Annotations provide a way to configure tests and suites in a declarative way similar to modern OOP languages.
The annotation list is based on moder testing framework such as jUnit 5, RSpec.

Annotations allow to configure test infrastructure in a declarative way without anything stored in tables or config files. The framework runner scans the schema for all the suitable annotated packages, automatically configures suites, forms hierarchy from then and executes them.

# Example of annotated package
```
create or replace package test_pkg is

  -- %suite(Name of suite)
  -- %suitepath(all.globaltests)

  -- %beforeall
  procedure globalsetup;

  -- %afterall
  procedure global_teardown;

  /* Such comments are allowed */

  -- %test
  -- %displayname(Name of test1)
  procedure test1;

  -- %test(Name of test2)
  -- %beforetest(setup_test1)
  -- %aftertest(teardown_test1)
  procedure test2;

  -- %test
  -- %displayname(Name of test3)
  -- %disable
  procedure test3;
  
  -- %test(Name of test4)
  -- %rollback(manual)
  procedure test4;

  procedure setup_test1;

  procedure teardown_test1;

  -- %beforeeach
  procedure setup;

  -- %aftereach
  procedure teardown;

end test_pkg;
```

#Annotations meaning

| Annotation |Level| Describtion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `%suite(<description>)` | Package | Marks package to be a suite of tests This way all testing packages might be found in a schema. Optional schema discription can by provided, similar to `%displayname` annotation. |
| `%suitepath(<path>)` | Package | Similar to java package. The annotation allows logical grouping of suites into hierarcies. |
| `%displayname(<description>)` | Package/procedure | Human-familiar describtion of the suite/test. Syntax is based on jUnit annotation: `%displayname(Name of the suite/test)` |
| `%test(<description>)` | Procedure | Denotes that a method is a test method.  Optional test discription can by provided, similar to `%displayname` annotation. |
| `%beforeall` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed once before all elements of the current suite. |
| `%afterall` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed once after all elements of the current suite. |
| `%beforeeach` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed before each `%test` method in the current suite. |
| `%aftereach` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed after each `%test` method in the current suite. |
| `%beforetest(<procedure_name>)` | Procedure | Denotes that mentioned procedure should be executed before the annotated `%test` procedure. |
| `%aftertest(<procedure_name>)` | Procedure | Denotes that mentioned procedure should be executed after the annotated `%test` procedure. |
| `%rollback(<type>)` | Package/procedure | Configure transaction control behaviour (type). Supported values: `auto`(default) - rollback to savepoint (before the test/suite setup) is issued after each test/suite teardown; `manual` - rollback is never issued automatically. Property can be overridden for child element (test in suite) |
| `%disable` | Package/procedure | Used to disable a suite or a test |
