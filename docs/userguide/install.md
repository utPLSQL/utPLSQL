# Downloading latest version of utPLSQL

To download latest version of utPLSQL from github on both Unix/Linux as well as Windows machines use the below snippets.

## Unix/Linux

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Get the url to latest release "zip" file
UTPLSQL_DOWNLOAD_URL=$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/releases/latest | awk '/browser_download_url/ { print $2 }' | grep ".zip\"" | sed 's/"//g')
# Download the latest release "zip" file
curl -Lk "${UTPLSQL_DOWNLOAD_URL}" -o utPLSQL.zip
# Extract downloaded "zip" file
unzip -q utPLSQL.zip
```

You may download with a one-liner if that is more convenient.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -LOk $(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/releases/latest | awk '/browser_download_url/ { print $2 }' | grep ".zip\"" | sed 's/"//g') 
```

## Windows

To run the script on windows you will need [PowerShell 3.0](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2013/06/02/weekend-scripter-install-powershell-3-0-on-windows-7/) or above. 
You will also need .NET 4.0 Framework or above.

```batch
$archiveName = 'utPLSQL.zip'
$latestRepo = Invoke-WebRequest https://api.github.com/repos/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/releases/latest
$repo = $latestRepo.Content | Convertfrom-Json

$urlList = $repo.assets.browser_download_url

Add-Type -assembly "system.io.compression.filesystem"

foreach ($i in $urlList) {

   $fileName = $i.substring($i.LastIndexOf("/") + 1)

   if ( $fileName.substring($fileName.LastIndexOf(".") + 1) -eq 'zip' ) {
      Invoke-WebRequest $i -OutFile $archiveName
      $fileLocation = Get-ChildItem | where {$_.Name -eq $archiveName}

      if ($fileLocation) {
         [io.compression.zipfile]::ExtractToDirectory($($fileLocation.FullName),$($fileLocation.DirectoryName))   
      }
   }
}
```

# Checking environment and utPLSQL version

To check the framework version execute the following query:
```sql
select substr(ut.version(),1,60) as ut_version from dual;
```

Additionally you may retrieve more information about your environment by executing the following query:
```sql
select 
  xmlserialize( content xmltype(ut_run_info()) as clob indent size = 2 )
  from dual;
```

# Supported database versions

The utPLSQL may be installed on any supported version of Oracle Database [see](http://www.oracle.com/us/support/library/lifetime-support-technology-069183.pdf#page=6)
* 11g R2 
* 12c
* 12c R2
* 18c
* 19c

# Headless installation

utPLSQL can be installed with DDL trigger, to enable tracking of DDL changes to your unit test packages.
This is the recommended installation approach, when you want to compile and run unit test packages in a schema containing huge amount of database packages (for example Oracle EBS installation schema).
The reason for having DDL trigger is to enable in-time annotation parsing for utPLSQL.
Without DDL trigger, utPLSQL needs to investigate your schema objects last_ddl_timestamp each time tests are executed to check if any of DB packages were changed in given schema and if they need scanning for annotation changes.
This process can be time-consuming if DB schema is large.     

The headless scripts accept three optional parameters that define:
- username to create as owner of utPLSQL (default `ut3`)  
- password for owner of utPLSQL (default `XNtxj8eEgA6X6b6f`)
- tablespace to use for storage of profiler data (default `users`)  

The scripts need to be executed by `SYSDBA`, in order to grant access to `DBMS_LOCK` and `DBMS_CRYPTO` system packages.

**Note:**
> Grant on `DBMS_LOCK` is required only for installation on Oracle versions below 18c. For versions 18c and above, utPLSQL uses `DBMS_SESSION.SLEEP` so access to `DBMS_LOCK` package is no longer needed. 

**Note:**
> The user performing the installation must have the `ADMINISTER DATABASE TRIGGER` privilege. This is required for installation of trigger that is responsible for parsing annotations at at compile-time of a package.

**Note:**
> When installing with DDL trigger, utPLSQL will not be registering unit tests for any of oracle-maintained schemas.
For Oracle 11g following users are excluded:
> ANONYMOUS, APPQOSSYS, AUDSYS, DBSFWUSER, DBSNMP, DIP, GGSYS, GSMADMIN_INTERNAL, GSMCATUSER, GSMUSER, ORACLE_OCM, OUTLN, REMOTE_SCHEDULER_AGENT, SYS, SYS$UMF, SYSBACKUP, SYSDG, SYSKM, SYSRAC, SYSTEM, WMSYS, XDB, XS$NULL 
>
> For Oracle 12c and above the users returned by below query are excluded by utPLSQL:
>
>```sql
>  select username from all_users where oracle_maintained='Y';
>```
 
## Installation without DDL trigger

To install the utPLSQL into a new database schema and grant it to public, execute the script `install_headless.sql` as SYSDBA.

Example invocation of the script from command line:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus sys/sys_pass@db as sysdba @install_headless.sql  
```

Invoking script with parameters:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus sys/sys_pass@db as sysdba @install_headless.sql utp3 my_verySecret_password utp3_tablespace   
```

## Installation with DDL trigger

To install the utPLSQL into a new database schema and grant it to public, execute the script `install_headless_with_trigger.sql` as SYSDBA.

Example invocation of the script from command line:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus sys/sys_pass@db as sysdba @install_headless_with_trigger.sql  
```

Invoking script with parameters:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus sys/sys_pass@db as sysdba @install_headless_with_trigger.sql utp3 my_verySecret_password utp3_tablespace   
```

**Note:** 
>When installing utPLSQL into database with existing unit test packages, utPLSQL will not be able to already-existing unit test packages. When utPSLQL was installed with DDL trigger, you have to do one of:
>- Recompile existing Unit Test packages to make utPLSQL aware of their existence 
>- Invoke `exec ut_runner.rebuild_annotation_cache(a_schema_name=> ... );` for every schema containing unit tests in your database
>
> Steps above are required to assure annotation cache is populated properly from existing objects. Rebuilding annotation cache might be faster than code recompilation.     

# Recommended Schema
It is highly recommended to install utPLSQL in it's own schema. You are free to choose any name for this schema.
Installing uPLSQL into shared schema is really not recommended as you loose isolation of framework.

If the installing user and utPLSQL owner is one and the same, the user must have the following Oracle system permissions before you can proceed with the installation.

  - CREATE SESSION
  - CREATE PROCEDURE
  - CREATE TYPE
  - CREATE TABLE
  - CREATE SEQUENCE
  - CREATE VIEW
  - CREATE SYNONYM
  - ALTER SESSION
  - CREATE TRIGGER
  
In addition the user must be granted the execute privilege on `DBMS_LOCK` and `DBMS_CRYPTO` packages.
    
utPLSQL is using [DBMS_PROFILER tables](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18283_01/appdev.112/e16760/d_profil.htm#i999476) for code coverage. The tables required by DBMS_PROFILER will be created in the installation schema unless they already exist.
The uninstall process will **not** drop profiler tables, as they can potentially be shared and reused for profiling PLSQL code.

It is up to DBA to maintain the storage of the profiler tables.

# Manual installation procedure

## Creating schema for utPLSQL
To create the utPLSQL schema and grant all the required privileges execute script `create_utplsql_owner.sql` from the `source` directory with parameters:

  - `user name` - the name of the user that will own of utPLSQL object
  - `password`  - the password to be set for that user
  - `tablespace name` - the tablespace name to hold data created during test execution

Example invocation:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus sys/sys_password@database as sysdba @create_utPLSQL_owner.sql ut3 ut3 users  
```

## Installing utPLSQL
To install the utPLSQL framework into your database, go to `source` directory, run the `install.sql` providing the `schema_name` for utPLSQL as parameter.  
Schema must be created prior to calling the `install` script.
You may install utPLSQL from any account that has sufficient privileges to create objects in other users schema.  

Example invocation:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus admin/admins_password@database @install.sql ut3  
```

## Installing DDL trigger
To minimize startup time of utPLSQL framework (especially on a database with large schema) it is recommended to install utPLSQL DDL trigger to enable utPLSQL annotation to be updated at compile-time.

It's recommended to install DDL trigger when connected as `SYSDBA` user. Trigger is created in utPLSQL schema.
If using the owner schema of utPLSQL to install trigger, the owner needs to have `ADMINISTER DATABASE TRIGGER` and `CREATE TRIGGER` system privileges. 
If using different user to install trigger, the user needs to have `ADMINISTER DATABASE TRIGGER` and `CREATE ANY TRIGGER` system privileges. 

To install DDL trigger go to `source` directory, run the `install_ddl_trigger.sql` providing the `schema_name` for utPLSQL as parameter.

Example invocation:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus admin/admins_password@database @install_ddl_trigger.sql ut3  
```

**Note:**
>Trigger can be installed ant any point in time.


## Allowing other users to access the utPLSQL framework
In order to allow other users to access utPLSQL, synonyms must be created and privileges granted.
You have two options:

  - use grants and synonyms to public, to allow all users to access the framework
  - use synonyms and grants for individual users to limit the access to the framework
 
To grant utPLSQL to public execute script `source/create_synonyms_and_grants_for_public.sql` and provide `schema_name` where utPLSQL is installed. 

Example invocation:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus admin/admins_password@database @create_synonyms_and_grants_for_public.sql ut3  
```
To grant utPLSQL to an individual user, execute scripts `source/create_user_grants.sql` and `source/create_user_synonyms.sql`, provide `schema_name` where utPLSQL is installed and `user_name` to grant access for.

Example invocation:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus ut3_user/ut3_password@database @create_user_grants.sql ut3 hr
sqlplus user/user_password@database @create_user_synonyms.sql ut3 hr
```

The following tools that support the SQL*Plus commands can be used to run the installation script:

  - SQL*Plus
  - [SQLcl](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview/index.html)
  - [Oracle SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/overview/index.html)
 
# Additional requirements

In order to use the Code Coverage functionality of utPLSQL, users executing the tests must have the CREATE privilege on the PLSQL code that the coverage is gathered on.
This is a requirement of [DBMS_PROFILER package](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18283_01/appdev.112/e16760/d_profil.htm#i999476).

In practice, user running tests for PLSQL code that he does not own, needs to have CREATE ANY PROCEDURE/CREATE ANY TRIGGER privileges.
Running code coverage on objects that the user does not own will **not produce any coverage information** without those privileges.

# Uninstalling utPLSQL

To uninstall run `uninstall.sql` and provide `schema_name` where utPLSQL is installed.

Example invocation:
```bash
cd source
sqlplus admin/admins_password@database @uninstall.sql ut3
```

The uninstall script will remove all the objects installed by the install script.
Additionally, all the public and private synonyms pointing to the objects in the utPLSQL schema will be removed.

If you have extended any utPLSQL types such as a custom reporter, these will need to be dropped before the uninstall, otherwise the uninstall script might fail.

The uninstall script does not drop the schema.

**In order for the uninstall to be successful, you need to use the uninstall script that was provided with the exact utPLSQL version installed on your database.**
i.e. the uninstall script provided with version 3.0.1 will probably not work if you want to remove version 3.0.0 from your database.

Alternatively you can drop the user that owns utPLSQL and re-create it using headless install.

# Version upgrade

Currently, the only way to upgrade version of utPLSQL v3.0.0 and above is to remove the previous version and install the new version.

# Working with utPLSQL v2

If you are using utPLSQL v2, you can still install utPLSQL v3.
The only requirement is that utPLSQL v3 needs to be installed in a different schema than utPLSQL v2.

utPLSQL v3 and utPLSQL v2 do not collide on public synonym names.
