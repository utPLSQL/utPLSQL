# Annotations

Annotations are used to configure tests and suites in a declarative way similar to modern OOP languages. This way, test configuration is stored along with the test logic inside the test package.
No configuration files or tables are needed. The annotation names are based on popular testing frameworks such as JUnit.
The framework runner searches for all the suitable annotated packages, automatically configures suites, forms the suite hierarchy, executes it and reports results in specified formats.

Annotations are interpreted only in the package specification and are case-insensitive. We strongly recommend using lower-case annotations as described in this documentation.

There are two distinct types of annotations, identified by their location in package:
- Procedure level annotations - placed directly before a procedure (`--%test`, `--%beforeall`, `--%beforeeach` etc.).
- Package level annotations   - placed at any place in package except directly before procedure (`--%suite`, `--%suitepath` etc.).

We strongly recommend putting package level annotations at the very top of package except for the `--%context` annotations (described below)  


## Supported annotations

| Annotation |Level| Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--%suite(<description>)` | Package | Mandatory. Marks package as a test suite. Optional suite description can be provided (see `displayname`). |
| `--%suitepath(<path>)` | Package | Similar to java package. The annotation allows logical grouping of suites into hierarchies. |
| `--%displayname(<description>)` | Package/procedure | Human-readable and meaningful description of a suite/test. `%displayname(Name of the suite/test)`. The annotation is provided for flexibility and convenience only. It has exactly the same meaning as `<description>` in `test` and `suite` annotations. If description is provided using both `suite`/`test` and `displayname`, then the one defined as last takes precedence. |
| `--%test(<description>)` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure is a unit test procedure.  Optional test description can by provided (see `displayname`). |
| `--%throws(<exception>[,...])`| Procedure | Denotes that the annotated test procedure must throw one of the exceptions provided. Supported forms of exceptions are: numeric literals, numeric contant names, exception constant names, predefined Oracle exception names. |
| `--%beforeall` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed once before all elements of the suite. |
| `--%beforeall([[<owner>.]<package>.]<procedure>[,...])` | Package | Denotes that the mentioned procedure(s) should be executed once before all elements of the suite. |
| `--%afterall` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed once after all elements of the suite. |
| `--%afterall([[<owner>.]<package>.]<procedure>[,...])` | Package | Denotes that the mentioned procedure(s) should be executed once after all elements of the suite. |
| `--%beforeeach` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed before each `%test` procedure in the suite. |
| `--%beforeeach([[<owner>.]<package>.]<procedure>[,...])` | Package | Denotes that the mentioned procedure(s) should be executed before each `%test` procedure in the suite. |
| `--%aftereach` | Procedure | Denotes that the annotated procedure should be executed after each `%test` procedure in the suite. |
| `--%aftereach([[<owner>.]<package>.]<procedure>[,...])` | Package | Denotes that the mentioned procedure(s) should be executed after each `%test` procedure in the suite. |
| `--%beforetest([[<owner>.]<package>.]<procedure>[,...])` | Procedure | Denotes that mentioned procedure(s) should be executed before the annotated `%test` procedure. |
| `--%aftertest([[<owner>.]<package>.]<procedure>[,...])` | Procedure | Denotes that mentioned procedure(s) should be executed after the annotated `%test` procedure. |
| `--%rollback(<type>)` | Package/procedure | Defines transaction control. Supported values: `auto`(default) - a savepoint is created before invocation of each "before block" is and a rollback to specific savepoint is issued after each "after" block; `manual` - rollback is never issued automatically. Property can be overridden for child element (test in suite) |
| `--%disabled` | Package/procedure | Used to disable a suite or a test. Disabled suites/tests do not get executed, they are however marked and reported as disabled in a test run. |
| `--%context(<name>)` | Package | Denotes start of a named context (sub-suite) in a suite package |
| `--%endcontext` | Package | Denotes end of a nested context (sub-suite) in a suite package |

### Suite

The `--%suite` annotation denotes PLSQL package as a unit test suite.
It accepts an optional description that will be visible when running the tests.
When description is not provided, package name is displayed on report.

**Note**
>Package is considered a test-suite only when package specification contains the `--%suite` annotation at the package level.
>
>Some annotations like `--%suite`, `--%test` and `--%displayname` accept parameters. The parameters for annotations need to be placed in brackets.
Values for parameters should be provided without any quotation marks.
If the parameters are placed without brackets or with incomplete brackets, they will be ignored.
>
>Example: `--%suite(The name of suite without closing bracket`
>Example: `--%suite The name of suite without brackets`


Suite package without description.
```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite
end;

  --%suite(Tests for a package)
  --%suite(Bad annotation)
end;
/
```
```sql

When `--%suite` annotation is bound to procedure, it is ignored and results in package not getting recognized as test suite.
```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite(Tests for a package)
  procedure some_proc;
end;
/
```
```sql
exec ut.run('test_package');

### Test

The `--%test` annotation denotes procedure withing test suite as a unit test.
It accepts an optional description that will be reported when the test is executed.
When description is not provided, procedure name is displayed on report.


If `--%test` raises an unhandled exception the following will happen:
- the test will be marked as errored and exception stack trace will be captured and reported
- the `--%aftertest`, `--%aftereach` procedures **will be executed** for the errored test
- the `--%afterall` procedures **will be executed**
- test execution will continue uninterrupted for rest of the suite

```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite(Tests for a package)

  --%test(Description of tested behavior)
  procedure some_test;

  --%test(Description of another behavior)
  --%disabled
  procedure other_test;
end;
/
create or replace package body test_package as
  
  procedure some_test is begin null; end;
  
  procedure other_test is begin null; end;

  Description of another behavior [0 sec] (DISABLED)
 
Finished in .005868 seconds
2 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored, 1 disabled, 0 warning(s)
```

### Beforeall

There are two possible ways  to use the `--%beforeall` annotation.

As a procedure level annotation:
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%beforeall
procedure to_be_executed_before_all;

--%test
procedure some_test;
```
Marks annotated procedure to be executed before all test procedures in a suite.

As a package level annotation (not associated with any procedure).
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%beforeall(to_be_executed_before_all, other_package.some_setup)

--%test
procedure some_test;

procedure to_be_executed_before_all;

```
Indicates that the procedure(s) mentioned as the annotation parameter are to be executed before all test procedures in a suite.


If `--%beforeall` raises an exception, suite content cannot be safely executed as the setup was not executed successfully for the suite. 

If `--%beforeall` raises an exception the following will happen:
- the `--%beforeall` procedures that follow the failed one, **will not be executed**
- all `--%test` procedures and their `--%beforeeach`, `--%aftereach`, `--%beforetest` and `--%aftertest` procedures within suite package **will not be executed**
- all `--%test` procedures **will be marked as failed**
- the `--%afterall` procedures **will be executed**
- test execution will continue uninterrupted for other suite packages 

When multiple `--%beforeall` procedures are defined in a suite package, all of them will be executed before invoking any test.

For multiple `--%beforeall` procedures order of execution is defined by annotation position in the package specification.

```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite(Tests for a package)

  --%test(Description of tested behavior)
  procedure some_test;

  --%test(Description of another behavior)
  procedure other_test;

  --%beforeall
  procedure setup_stuff;
  
end;
/
create or replace package body test_package as
  procedure setup_stuff is
  begin
    dbms_output.put_line('--- SETUP_STUFF invoked ---');
  end;
  
  procedure some_test is begin null; end;
  
  procedure other_test is begin null; end;
end;
/
```

```sql
exec ut.run('test_package');
```
```
Tests for a package
  --- SETUP_STUFF invoked ---
  Description of tested behavior [.004 sec]
  Description of another behavior [.003 sec]
 
Finished in .012292 seconds
2 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored, 0 disabled, 0 warning(s)
```

In the below example a combination pacakge and procedure level `--%beforeall` annotations is used.
The order of execution of the beforeall procedures is determined by the annotation position in package. 
All of the `--%beforeall` procedures get invoked before any test is executed in a suite.  
 ```sql
  create or replace package test_package as
    --%suite(Tests for a package)
  
    --%beforeall(initial_setup,test_package.another_setup)
  
    --%test(Description of tested behavior)
    procedure some_test;
  
    --%test(Description of another behavior)
    procedure other_test;
     
    --%beforeall
    procedure next_setup;
  
    --%beforeall(one_more_setup)

    procedure another_setup;
    procedure one_more_setup;
    procedure initial_setup;
 
  end;
  /
  create or replace package body test_package as
    procedure one_more_setup is
    begin
      dbms_output.put_line('--- ONE_MORE_SETUP invoked ---');
    end;
    
    procedure next_setup is
    begin
      dbms_output.put_line('--- NEXT_SETUP invoked ---');
    end;
    
    procedure another_setup is
    begin
      dbms_output.put_line('--- ANOTHER_SETUP invoked ---');
    end;
    
    procedure initial_setup is
    begin
      dbms_output.put_line('--- INITIAL_SETUP invoked ---');
    end;
    
    procedure some_test is begin null; end;
    
    procedure other_test is begin null; end;
  end;
  /
 ```

 ```sql
 exec ut.run('test_package');
 ```
 ```
Tests for a package
  --- INITIAL_SETUP invoked ---
  --- ANOTHER_SETUP invoked ---
  --- NEXT_SETUP invoked ---
  --- ONE_MORE_SETUP invoked ---
  Description of tested behavior [.003 sec]
  Description of another behavior [.002 sec]
 
Finished in .018944 seconds
2 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored, 0 disabled, 0 warning(s)
 ```

When multiple `--%beforeall` annotations are specified for a procedure, the first annotation will be used and a warning message will appear indicating duplicate annotation.  
When procedure is annotated as both `--%beforeall` and `--%test`, the procedure will become a test and a warning message will appear indicating invalid annotation combination.    
```sql
 create or replace package test_package as
   --%suite(Tests for a package)
 
   --%beforeall
   --%beforeall
   procedure initial_setup;
   
   --%test(Description of tested behavior)
   --%beforeall
   procedure some_test;
 
   --%test(Description of another behavior)
   procedure other_test;
 
 end;
 /
 create or replace package body test_package as

   procedure initial_setup is
   begin
     dbms_output.put_line('--- INITIAL_SETUP invoked ---');
   end;

   procedure some_test is begin null; end;

   procedure other_test is begin null; end;
 end;
 /
```

 ```sql
 exec ut.run('test_package');
 ```
 ```
Tests for a package
  --- INITIAL_SETUP invoked ---
  Description of tested behavior [.003 sec]
  Description of another behavior [.004 sec]
 
 
Warnings:
 
  1) test_package
      Duplicate annotation "--%beforeall". Annotation ignored.
      at "UT3_TESTER.TEST_PACKAGE.INITIAL_SETUP", line 5
  2) test_package

Finished in .012158 seconds
2 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored, 0 disabled, 2 warning(s)
 ```


### Afterall

There are two possible ways  to use the `--%afterall` annotation.

As a procedure level annotation:
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%afterall
procedure to_be_executed_after_all;

--%test
procedure some_test;
```
Marks annotated procedure to be executed after all test procedures in a suite.

As a package level annotation (not associated with any procedure).
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%afterall(to_be_executed_after_all, other_package.some_cleanup)

--%test
procedure some_test;

procedure to_be_executed_after_all;

```
Indicates that the procedure(s) mentioned as the annotation parameter are to be executed after all test procedures in a suite.

If `--%afterall` raises an exception the following will happen:
- a warning will be raised, indicating that `--%afterall` procedure has failed
- execution will continue uninterrupted for rest of the suite 

If `--%afterall` raises an exception, it can have negative impact on other tests, as the environment was not cleaned-up after the tests. 
This however doesn't have direct impact on test execution within current suite, as the tests are already complete by the time `--%afterall` is called. 

When multiple `--%afterall` procedures are defined in a suite, all of them will be executed after invoking all tests from the suite.

For multiple `--%afterall` procedures order of execution is defined by annotation position in the package specification.

All rules defined for `--%beforeall` also apply for `--%afterall` annotation. See [beforeall](#Beforeall) for more details.

```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite(Tests for a package)

  --%test(Description of tested behavior)
  procedure some_test;

  --%test(Description of another behavior)
  procedure other_test;

  --%afterall
  procedure cleanup_stuff;
  
end;
/
create or replace package body test_package as
  procedure cleanup_stuff is
  begin
    dbms_output.put_line('---CLEANUP_STUFF invoked ---');
  end;
  
  procedure some_test is begin null; end;
  
  procedure other_test is begin null; end;
end;
/
```

```sql
exec ut.run('test_package');
```
```
Tests for a package
  Description of tested behavior [.003 sec]
  Description of another behavior [.005 sec]
  ---CLEANUP_STUFF invoked ---
 
Finished in .014161 seconds
2 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored, 0 disabled, 0 warning(s)
```

### Beforeeach

The procedure annotated as `--%beforeeach` is getting executed before each test in a suite.
That means that the procedure will be executed as many times as there are test in suite package.

There are two possible ways  to use the `--%beforeeach` annotation.

As a procedure level annotation:
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%beforeeach
procedure to_be_executed_before_each;

--%test
procedure some_test;
```
Marks annotated procedure to be executed before each test procedures in a suite.

As a package level annotation (not associated with any procedure).
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%beforeeach(to_be_executed_before_each, other_package.some_setup)

--%test
procedure some_test;

procedure to_be_executed_before_each;

```
Indicates that the procedure(s) mentioned as the annotation parameter are to be executed before each test procedure in a suite.


If a test is marked as disabled the `--%beforeeach` procedure is not invoked for that test.

If `--%beforeeach` raises an unhandled exception the following will happen:
- the following `--%beforeeach` as well as all `--%beforetest` for that test **will not be executed**
- the test will be marked as errored and exception stack trace will be captured and reported
- the `--%aftertest`, `--%aftereach` procedures **will be executed** for the errored test
- the `--%afterall` procedures **will be executed**
- test execution will continue uninterrupted for rest of the suite 

As a rule, the `--%beforeeach` execution gets aborted if preceding `--%beforeeach` failed. 

When multiple `--%beforeeach` procedures are defined in a suite, all of them will be executed before invoking each test.

For multiple `--%beforeeach` procedures order of execution is defined by annotation position in the package specification.

```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite(Tests for a package)

  --%test(Description of tested behavior)
  procedure some_test;

  --%test(Description of another behavior)
  procedure other_test;

  --%beforeeach
  procedure setup_for_test;
  
  --%beforeall
  procedure setup_stuff;
end;
/
create or replace package body test_package as
  procedure setup_stuff is
  begin
    dbms_output.put_line('---SETUP_STUFF invoked ---');
  end;

  procedure setup_for_test is
  begin
    dbms_output.put_line('---SETUP_FOR_TEST invoked ---');
  end;
  
  procedure some_test is 
  begin 
    dbms_output.put_line('---SOME_TEST invoked ---');
  end;
  
  procedure other_test is 
  begin 
    dbms_output.put_line('---OTHER_TEST invoked ---');
  end;
end;
/
```

```sql
exec ut.run('test_package');
```
```
Tests for a package
  ---SETUP_STUFF invoked ---
  Description of tested behavior [.004 sec]
  ---SETUP_FOR_TEST invoked ---

  Description of another behavior [.006 sec]
  ---SETUP_FOR_TEST invoked ---
  ---OTHER_TEST invoked ---
 
Finished in .014683 seconds
2 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored, 0 disabled, 0 warning(s)
```

See [beforeall](#Beforeall) for more examples.

### Aftereach

Marks annotated procedure to be executed after each test procedure in a suite.

The procedure annotated as `--%aftereach` is getting executed after each test in a suite.
That means that the procedure will be executed as many times as there are test in suite package.

There are two possible ways  to use the `--%aftereach` annotation.

As a procedure level annotation:
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%aftereach
procedure to_be_executed_after_each;

--%test
procedure some_test;
```
Marks annotated procedure to be executed after each test procedures in a suite.

As a package level annotation (not associated with any procedure).
```sql
--%suite(Some test suite)

--%aftereach(to_be_executed_after_each, other_package.some_setup)

--%test
procedure some_test;

procedure to_be_executed_after_each;

```
Indicates that the procedure(s) mentioned as the annotation parameter are to be executed after each test procedure in a suite.

If a test is marked as disabled the `--%aftereach` procedure is not invoked for that test.

If `--%aftereach` raises an unhandled exception the following will happen:
- the test will be marked as errored and exception stack trace will be captured and reported
- the `--%aftertest`, `--%aftereach` procedures **will be executed** for the errored test
- the `--%afterall` procedures **will be executed**
- test execution will continue uninterrupted for rest of the suite 

When multiple `--%aftereach` procedures are defined in a suite, all of them will be executed after invoking each test.

For multiple `--%aftereach` procedures order of execution is defined by the annotation position in the package specification.

As a rule, the `--%aftereach` gets executed even if the associated `--%beforeeach`, `--%beforetest`, `--%test` or other `--%aftereach` procedures have raised unhandled exceptions. 

```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite(Tests for a package)

  --%test(Description of tested behavior)
  procedure some_test;

  --%test(Description of another behavior)
  procedure other_test;

  --%aftereach
  procedure cleanup_for_test;
  
  --%afterall
  procedure cleanup_stuff;
end;
/
create or replace package body test_package as
  procedure cleanup_stuff is
  begin
    dbms_output.put_line('---CLEANUP_STUFF invoked ---');
  end;

  procedure cleanup_for_test is
  begin
    dbms_output.put_line('---CLEANUP_FOR_TEST invoked ---');
  end;
  
  procedure some_test is 
  begin 
    dbms_output.put_line('---SOME_TEST invoked ---');
  end;
  
  procedure other_test is 
  begin 
    dbms_output.put_line('---OTHER_TEST invoked ---');
  end;
end;
/
```
```sql
exec ut.run('test_package');
```
```
Tests for a package
  Description of tested behavior [.006 sec]
  ---SOME_TEST invoked ---
  ---CLEANUP_FOR_TEST invoked ---
  Description of another behavior [.006 sec]
  ---OTHER_TEST invoked ---
  ---CLEANUP_FOR_TEST invoked ---
  ---CLEANUP_STUFF invoked ---
 
Finished in .018115 seconds
2 tests, 0 failed, 0 errored, 0 disabled, 0 warning(s)
```

See [beforeall](#Beforeall) for more examples.

### Beforetest

Indicates specific setup procedure(s) to be executed for a test. The procedure(s) can be located either:
- within current package (package name is optional)
- within another package 
 
The annotation need to be placed alongside `--%test` annotation.

The `--%beforetest` procedures are executed after invoking all `--%beforeeach` for a test.

If a test is marked as disabled the `--%beforetest` procedures are not invoked for that test.

If `--%beforetest` raises an unhandled exception the following will happen:
- the following `--%beforetest` for that test **will not be executed**
- the test will be marked as errored and exception stack trace will be captured and reported
- the `--%aftertest`, `--%aftereach` procedures **will be executed** for the errored test
- the `--%afterall` procedures **will be executed**
- test execution will continue uninterrupted for rest of the suite 

When multiple `--%beforetest` procedures are defined for a test, all of them will be executed before invoking the test.

The order of execution for `--%beforetest` procedures is defined by:
- position of procedure on the list within single annotation
- annotation position

As a rule, the `--%beforetest` execution gets aborted if preceding `--%beforeeach` or `--%beforetest` failed. 

```sql
create or replace package test_package as
  --%suite(Tests for a package)

  --%test(Description of tested behavior)
  --%beforetest(test_package.setup_for_a_test)
  --%beforetest(another_setup_for_a_test)
  procedure some_test;

### Aftertest

Indicates specific cleanup procedure(s) to be executed for a test. The procedure(s) can be located either:
- within current package (package name is optional)
- within another package 
 
The annotation need to be placed alongside `--%test` annotation.

If a test is marked as disabled the `--%aftertest` procedures are not invoked for that test.

If `--%aftertest` raises an unhandled exception the following will happen:
- the test will be marked as errored and exception stack trace will be captured and reported
- the following `--%aftertest` and all `--%aftereach` procedures **will be executed** for the errored test
- the `--%afterall` procedures **will be executed**
- test execution will continue uninterrupted for rest of the suite 

When multiple `--%aftertest` procedures are defined for a test, all of them will be executed before invoking the test.

The order of execution for `--%aftertest` procedures is defined by:
- position of procedure on the list within single annotation
- annotation position

As a rule, the `--%aftertest` gets executed even if the associated `--%beforeeach`, `--%beforetest`, `--%test` or other `--%aftertest` procedures have raised unhandled exceptions. 

```sql
create or replace package test_package as

### Context

In most of the cases, the code to be tested is consisting of PLSQL packages containing procedures and functions.
When creating test suites, it's quite common to maintain `one to one` relationship between test suite packages and tested code.

When it comes to test procedures themselves, it is best practice to have one test procedure for one tested behavior of the code that is tested.
The relationship between test procedure and tested procedure/function will be therefore `many to one` in most of the cases.

With this comes a challenge. How to group tests, related to one tested procedure, so that it is obvious that they relate to the same code.

This is where utPLSQL contexts come handy. 

Contexts allow for creating sub-suites within a suite package and they allow for grouping of tests that are somehow related.

In essence, context behaves like a suite within a suite. 

Context have following characteristics:
- start with the `--%context` annotation and ends with `--%endcontext`
- can have a name provided as parameter for example `--%context(remove_rooms_by_name)`
- when no name is provided for context, the context is names `context_N` where `N` is the number of the context in suite 
- can have their own `--%beforeall`, `--%beforeeach`, `--%afterall` and `--%aftereach` procedures
- `--%beforeall`, `--%beforeeach`, `--%afterall` and `--%aftereach` procedures defined at suite level, propagate to context
- test suite package can have multiple contexts in it
- contexts cannot be nested


The below example illustrates usage of `--%context` for separating tests for individual procedures of package.

Tested tables and code
```sql
create table rooms (
  room_key number primary key,
  name varchar2(100) not null
);

create table room_contents (
  contents_key number primary key,
  room_key     number not null,
  name         varchar2(100) not null,
  create_date  timestamp default current_timestamp not null,
  constraint fk_rooms foreign key (room_key) references rooms (room_key)
);

create or replace package rooms_management is

  procedure remove_rooms_by_name( a_name rooms.name%type );

  procedure add_rooms_content( 
    a_room_name    rooms.name%type,
    a_content_name room_contents.name%type
  );

end;
/

create or replace package body rooms_management is
  procedure remove_rooms_by_name( a_name rooms.name%type ) is
  begin
    if a_name is null then
      raise program_error;
    end if;
    delete from rooms where name like a_name;
  end;
  
  procedure add_rooms_content( 
    a_room_name    rooms.name%type,
    a_content_name room_contents.name%type
  ) is
    l_room_key     rooms.room_key%type;
  begin
   
    select room_key into l_room_key 
      from rooms where name = a_room_name;
    
    insert into room_contents
          (contents_key, room_key, name)
    select nvl(max(contents_key)+1, 1) as contents_key,
           l_room_key,
           a_content_name
      from room_contents;
  end;
end;
/
```

Below test suite defines:
- `--%beforeall` outside of context, that will be executed before all tests
- `--%context(remove_rooms_by_name)` to group tests for `remove_rooms_by_name` procedure
- `--%context(add_rooms_content)` to group tests for `add_rooms_content` procedure

```sql
create or replace package test_rooms_management is

  gc_null_value_exception constant integer := -1400;
  --%suite(Rooms management)
  
  --%beforeall
  procedure setup_rooms;

end;
/

### Suitepath

It is very likely that the application for which you are going to introduce tests consists of many different packages, procedures and functions.
Usually procedures can be logically grouped inside a package, there also might be several logical groups of procedures in a single package and packages might be grouped into modules and modules into subject areas.

As your project grows, the codebase will grow to. utPLSQL allows you to group packages into modules and also allows for nesting modules. 

Let's say you have a complex insurance application that deals with policies, claims and payments. The payment module contains several packages for payment recognition, charging, planning etc. The payment recognition module among others contains a complex `recognize_payment` procedure that associates received money to the policies.

If you want to create tests for your application it is recommended to structure your tests similarly to the logical structure of your application. So you end up with something like:
* Integration tests
  *   Policy tests
  *   Claim tests
  *   Payment tests
    * Payments recognition
    * Payments set off

The `%suitepath` annotation is used for such grouping. Even though test packages are defined in a flat structure the `%suitepath` is used by the framework to form them into a hierarchical structure. Your payments recognition test package might look like:

```sql
create or replace package test_payment_recognition as

  --%suite(Payment recognition tests)
  --%suitepath(payments)

  --%test(Recognize payment by policy number)
  procedure test_recognize_by_num;

  --%test(Recognize payment by payment purpose)
  procedure test_recognize_by_purpose;

  --%test(Recognize payment by customer)
  procedure test_recognize_by_customer;

end test_payment_recognition;
```

And payments set off test package:
```sql
create or replace package test_payment_set_off as

  --%suite(Payment set off tests)
  --%suitepath(payments)

  --%test(Creates set off)
  procedure test_create_set_off;

  --%test(Cancels set off)
  procedure test_cancel_set_off;

end test_payment_set_off;
```

When you execute tests for your application, the framework constructs a test suite for each test package. Then it combines suites into grouping suites by the `%suitepath` annotation value so that the fully qualified path to the `recognize_by_num` procedure is `USER:payments.test_payment_recognition.test_recognize_by_num`. If any of its expectations fails then the test is marked as failed, also the `test_payment_recognition` suite, the parent suite `payments` and the whole run is marked as failed.
The test report indicates which expectation has failed on the payments module. The payments recognition submodule is causing the failure as `recognize_by_num` has not met the expectations of the test. Grouping tests into modules and submodules using the `%suitepath` annotation allows you to logically organize your project's flat structure of packages into functional groups.

An additional advantage of such grouping is the fact that every element level of the grouping can be an actual unit test package containing a common module level setup for all of the submodules. So in addition to the packages mentioned above you could have the following package.
```sql
create or replace package payments as

  --%suite(Payments)

  --%beforeall
  procedure set_common_payments_data;

  --%afterall
  procedure reset_common_paymnets_data;

end payments;
```
A `%suitepath` can be provided in three ways:
* schema - execute all tests in the schema
* [schema]:suite1[.suite2][.suite3]...[.procedure] - execute all tests in all suites from suite1[.suite2][.suite3]...[.procedure] path. If schema is not provided, then the current schema is used. Example: `:all.rooms_tests`
* [schema.]package[.procedure] - execute all tests in the specified test package. The whole hierarchy of suites in the schema is built before all before/after hooks or part suites for the provided suite package are executed as well. Example: `tests.test_contact.test_last_name_validator` or simply `test_contact.test_last_name_validator` if `tests` is the current schema.


### Rollback

By default, changes performed by every setup, cleanup and test procedure are isolated by savepoints.
This solution is suitable for use-cases where the code that is being tested as well as the unit tests themselves do not use transaction control (commit/rollback) or DDL commands.

In general, your unit tests should not use transaction control as long as the code you are testing is not using it too.
Keeping the transactions uncommitted allows your changes to be isolated and the execution of tests does not impact others who might be using a shared development database.

If you are in a situation where the code you are testing uses transaction control (common case with ETL code), then your tests probably should not use the default automatic transaction control.
In that case use the annotation `--%rollback(manual)` on the suite level to disable automatic transaction control for the entire suite.
If you are using nested suites, you need to make sure that the entire suite all the way to the root is using manual transaction control.

It is possible with utPLSQL to change the transaction control on individual suites or tests that are part of complex suite.
It is strongly recommended not to have mixed transaction control in a suite.
Mixed transaction control settings will not work properly when your suites are using shared setup/cleanup with beforeall, afterall, beforeeach or aftereach annotations.
Your suite will most likely fail with error or warning on execution. Some of the automatic rollbacks will probably fail to execute depending on the configuration you have.

In some cases it is necessary to perform DDL as part of setup or cleanup for the tests.
It is recommended to move such DDL statements to a procedure with `pragma autonomous_transaction` to eliminate implicit commits in the main session that is executing all your tests.
Doing so allows your tests to use the framework's automatic transaction control and releases you from the burden of manual cleanup of data that was created or modified by test execution.

When you are testing code that performs explicit or implicit commits, you may set the test procedure to run as an autonomous transaction with `pragma autonomous_transaction`.
Keep in mind that when your test runs as autonomous transaction it will not see the data prepared in a setup procedure unless the setup procedure committed the changes.

**Note**
> The `--%suitepath` annotation, when used, must be provided with a value of path.
> The path in suitepath cannot contain spaces. Dot (.) identifies individual elements of the path.
>
> Example: `--%suitepath(org.utplsql.core.utils)`
>


### Throws

The `--%throws` annotation allows you to specify a list of exceptions as one of:
- number literals - example `--%throws(-20134)`
- variables of type exception defined in a package specification - example `--%throws(exc_pkg.c_exception_No_variable)`
- variables of type number defined in a package specification - example `--%throws(exc_pkg.c_some_exception)`
- [predefined oracle exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/timesten.112/e21639/exceptions.htm#CIHFIGFE) - example `--%throws(no_data_found)`

The annotation is ignored, when no valid arguments are provided. Examples of invalid annotations `--%throws()`,`--%throws`, `--%throws(abe, 723pf)`.

If `--%throws` annotation is specified with arguments and no exception is raised, the test is marked as failed.

If `--%throws` annotation is specified with arguments and exception raised is not on the list of provided exceptions, the test is marked as failed.

The framework will raise a warning, when `--%throws` annotation has invalid arguments or when no arguments were provided.

Annotation `--%throws(7894562, operaqk, -=1, -20496, pow74d, posdfk3)` will be interpreted as `--%throws(-20496)`.
 
Please note that `NO_DATA_FOUND` exception is a special case in Oracle. To capture it use `NO_DATA_FOUND` named exception or `-1403` exception No.
                                                                                                        
Example:
```sql
create or replace package exc_pkg is
  c_e_option1  constant number := -20200;
  c_e_option2  constant varchar2(10) := '-20201';
  c_e_option3  number := -20202;
          
  e_option4 exception;
  pragma exception_init(e_option4, -20203);

**Note**
>utPLSQL does not guarantee ordering of tests in suite. On contrary utPLSQL might give random order of tests/contexts in suite.
>
>Order of execution within multiple occurrences of `before`/`after` procedures is determined by the order of annotations in specific block (context/suite) of package specification.


## Annotation cache

utPLSQL needs to scan the source of package specifications to identify and parse annotations.
To improve framework startup time, especially when dealing with database users owning large amounts of packages, the framework has a built-in persistent cache for annotations.

The annotation cache is checked for staleness and refreshed automatically on every run. The initial startup of utPLSQL for a schema will take longer than consecutive executions.

If you are in a situation where your database is controlled via CI/CD server and is refreshed/wiped before each run of your tests, consider building the annotation cache upfront and taking a snapshot of the database after the cache has been refreshed.

To build the annotation cache without actually invoking any tests, call `ut_runner.rebuild_annotation_cache(a_object_owner)` for every unit test owner for which you want to have the annotation cache prebuilt.
Example:
```sql
exec ut_runner.rebuild_annotation_cache('HR');
```

To purge the annotation cache call `ut_runner.purge_cache(a_object_owner, a_object_type)`.
Both parameters are optional and if not provided, all owners/object_types will be purged. 
Example:
```sql
exec ut_runner.purge_cache('HR', 'PACKAGE');
```
