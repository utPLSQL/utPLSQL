<h1>Custom Reporter Packages</h1>
<p>Generally, the default output provided by utPLSQL is sufficient.  This 
just writes to the screen using DBMS_OUTPUT.  If you are running it 
interactively while doing some development, you just need to know if the tests
are passing and details of the failing tests.
However, there are cases where you'd like the results to be reported in a
different format, especially when the tests are being run in batch mode.  To
support this, utPLSQL has the concept of Reporter Packages. utPLSQL is 
distributed with the following reporter packages as standard:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#outputreporter">Output Reporter</a></li>
	<li><a href="#filereporter">File Reporter</a></li>
	<li><a href="#htmlreporter">HTML Reporter</a></li>
</ul>

The naming convention is that reporter packages are called
UT<i><b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b></i>REPORTER. To set which reporter is used, you will
need to call <a href="utconfig.html#setgetreporter">utConfig.Setreporter</a>, passing the name of the reporter.
To use the HTML reporter for example, you should issue the following command:
<pre>BEGIN
   utConfig.setreporter('HTML');
END; </pre>

For more details of how to develop your own custom
reporter package, see <a href="#custom">below</a>.

<h2><a name="outputreporter"></a>Output Reporter</h2>

<p>Contained in the UTOUTPUTREPORTER package, this simply encapsulates the
standard behaviour, whereby the output is written out to DBMS_OUTPUT.  When a
problem occurs with another reporter, utPLSQL will automatically fall back on
this mechanism to report problems.  This means it is wise to have DBMS_OUTPUT
enabled even if you are using another output method.</p>

<h2><a name="filereporter"></a>File Reporter</h2>

<p>This reporter, contained in the UTFILEREPORTER package, writes test results
out to a file.  For details on how to configure this process, see the details 
which can be found <a href="fileout.html">here</a>.  This functionality was
available before version 2.2 of utPLSQL, but has now been moved into its own
package.</p>

<h2><a name="htmlreporter"></a>HTML Reporter</h2>

<p>The package UTHTMLREPORTER is really just an example package to be used as 
a basis for your own custom reporters.  It builds on the filereporter described above to 
send results to a file.  The difference is that the results are presented in a (rather crude) 
HTML table.</p>

<h2><a name="custom"></a>Writing your own Reporter</h2>

<p>To define your own reporter package you need it conform to a particular API.  The various 
procedures are then registered as 'callbacks' for utPLSQL to use.
An example package spec is given below. 
<pre>
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE utMyRssReporter
IS

   PROCEDURE open;
   PROCEDURE pl (str IN VARCHAR2);
   
   PROCEDURE before_results(run_id IN utr_outcome.run_id%TYPE);
   PROCEDURE show_failure;
   PROCEDURE show_result;
   PROCEDURE after_results(run_id IN utr_outcome.run_id%TYPE);
   
   PROCEDURE before_errors(run_id IN utr_error.run_id%TYPE);
   PROCEDURE show_error;
   PROCEDURE after_errors(run_id IN utr_error.run_id%TYPE);   
   
   PROCEDURE close;

END utMyRssReporter;
/
</pre>
</p>
Your reporter package can define other functions and procedures, for example to allow configuration, but all the procedures shown above should be defined. 
The usage of these procedures is as follows:
<h3>open</h3>
<p>This is called at the very start of the process and is the ideal place to do initialization, such as opening any files that you will be writing to.</p>

<h3>pl</h3>
<p>This is a general routine to simply write out the given string for purposes of logging etc.  
If you don't want this to show up in your output, you can simply call <code>utoutputreporter.pl</code> to send this to DBMS_OUTPUT instead.</p>

<h3>before_results</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, this is called before the results are output. Note that the tests have already completed at this point,
so it is possible to call <code>utresult.success (run_id)</code> to determine if the run was a success or not and display a large banner.</p>

<h3>show_failure</h3>
<p>This is called when a failure is reported and we are only showing failures (i.e. <a href="utconfig.html#showfailuresonly">utconfig.showfailuresonly</a> has been set).
To get details of the failure, you will need to examine the package level record <code>utreport.outcome</code>.</p>

<h3>show_result</h3>
<p>This is called whenever a result is reported and we are showing all results.  To get details, you will need to examine <code>utreport.outcome</code>. See below for details.</p>

<h3>after_results</h3>
<p>This is called after all the results have been sent for output.</p>

<h3>before_errors</h3>
<p>This is called before any errors are sent for output.</p>

<h3>show_error</h3>
<p>This is called for each error to output.  To get details, you will need to examine the package level record <code>utreport.error</code>.  See below for details.</p>

<h3>after_errors</h3>
<p>This is called after any errors have been sent for output.</p>

<h2><a name="reportrecords"></a>Outcome and Error records</h2>
<p>In order to keep the API as simple as possible, many of the procedures defined above take no parameters.  In particular, details of the outcome or error which
triggered the callback are not passed through to your procedure.  These are stored as package level records in the utReport package as shown below.  

<pre>outcome utr_outcome%ROWTYPE;
error utr_error%ROWTYPE;</pre>

The important fields in the outcome record are:
<ul>
	<li>status - This is a string which is either "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE" depending on the outcome of this test.</li>
	<li>description - The text describing the success or failure.</li>
</ul>

The important fields in the error record are:
<ul>
	<li>errlevel - The Error Level</li>
	<li>errcode - The Error Code</li>
	<li>errtext - The Description of the error that occurred</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Using Your Custom Reporter</h2>
To use your custom reporter, you simply call <a href="utconfig.html#setgetreporter">utConfig.Setreporter</a> with the name of your reporter.  So if
you have defined your reporter in the utMyRssReporter package, you need to call:

<pre>BEGIN
   utConfig.setreporter('MyRss');
END; </pre>

Then you just run your tests as usual and hopefully your reporter will format the results as you expect.  

<h3>Sending output to the current reporter</h3>
If you wish to send output to the current reporter, for example, for logging purposes, you should call utReport.pl.  
This is part of the utReport package, which acts as a facade and passes any calls through to the current reporter package. 
So if you have set up a custom reporter package 'utMyRssReporter' as shown above and called utConfig.setreporter('MyRss'), 
any calls such as the following:

<pre>BEGIN
  utReport.pl('Logging Message');
END;</pre>

will be equivalent to 

<pre>BEGIN
  utMyRssReporter.pl('Logging Message');
END;</pre>
