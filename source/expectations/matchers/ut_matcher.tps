    function: run_matcher

    A superclass function that executes the matcher.
    This is actually a fallback function, that should be called by subtype when there is a data type mismatch.
    The subtype should override this function and return:
    - true for success of a matcher,
    - false for faulure of a matcher,
    - null when result cannot be determined (type mismatch or exception)
